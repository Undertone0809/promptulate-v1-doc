# Memory

:::info
Documentation in progress...
:::

When using the Agent and Prompt Framework normally, information is stateless by default, meaning that the messages generated during the interaction are not persisted. However, in some applications, such as chatbots, it is necessary to use the historical data of the previous conversation, and this is where message persistence comes in. `promptulate`
provides a Memory module for the Agent and Framework modules to persist data.

**The Memory module can provide:**

- Conversation records generated by the user's interaction with LLM
- Storage of Agent-related configuration information (planned)
- Conversation information persistence
- Support for storage in different types of storage media

**Current storage methods supported by Memory**

- buffer temporary cache
- file storage
- Relational database storage (planned)

## Using memory in the Framework
